Introduction
	New York City Local Law 18 of 2018, also known as NYC LL 18/2018, was a significant piece of legislation that impacted short-term rental regulations in New York City. The law went into effect on September 7, 2023. The law clarified the definition of short-term rentals. In New York City, it generally referred to rentals of less than 30 consecutive days. Violations of the law could result in substantial fines for both hosts and hosting platforms. The law was aimed, in part, at addressing concerns about the impact of short-term rentals on the availability of affordable housing in the city.

The work to be performed by the team is:
Be able to clarify if there are any visible changes in derived topics for the reviews before the law went into effect and after the law went into effect.
Evaluate listing descriptions to discern how hosts are promoting their spaces in the context of the new guidelines
Categorize listings based on specific features to observe if particular groupings reduce following the law's introduction.
